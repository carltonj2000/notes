# Node Course

The code in this repository is base of the
[The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/learn/v4/overview)
course.

Use `repl` in the node debugger CLI to get to the _repl_ and inspect data.
For chrome debugging use the url `chrome://inspect` and on that screen
don't select the option under Remote Target but
_Open dedicated DevTools for Node_.
